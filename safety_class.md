# Safety Class

Outline for a basic safety class we ran at Bozeman Makerspace.

## Tools

### Basic Shop Safety

- Safety glasses, ear plugs/muffs, fire extinguisher, first aid kit
- Slow down

### Table Saw

- Press down, into the fence and then through
- Stand slightly to the side
- Use a push stick for small pieces
- If it starts to get hard to push, stop where you are and turn the saw off (keep a hand on the wood)
- Thin material is more likely to kick back
- No loose clothing

### Drill Press

- It is easy for things to get away from you, clamps are a good idea
- Make sure the bit will go all the way through before you start
- Line the pedestal up

### Shapeoko

- Very similar to drill press
- Remember eye protection, breaking a bit is possible.

### Sander

- On the disc, always use the downward side
- On the belt, sanding up against the stop is a good idea
- Watch your fingers

### Band Saw

- Lower the blade guide to slightly off the surface of the wood
- Don't try to cut too dramatic of a curve
- It can't get a bunch of sawdust inside. Open the door and vacuum it out occasionally.
- Going really slow is much better.
- Make sure the blade is centered by looking through the window.

### Router

- For edge bits, feed from the left side
- Be very careful while it is spinning down

### Circular Saw and saw horses

- Use support sacrificial 2 x 4s to help prevent the stuff falling
- Adjust the shoe so it sticks a little bit below the wood you're cutting

### 3D Printer

- The extruder (and bed on the larger one) is hot

### Cutting

- Knives, scissors, razors - cut away from yourself. CUT AWAY FROM YOURSELF!
- Be careful, when cleaning them off.

### Soldering Iron

- Turn them off when you are done.
- Eye protection

### High Voltage

- If you do not know what you are doing you should NOT be working with High Voltage!
- Do not use both hands to grab something
- Do not just clamp down on something with your hand. If you are electrocuted, you will be unable to let go
- If somebody is electrocuted, do not run up and grab them

### Chemicals

- Do not leave unused chemicals laying out
- Pay attention to labels
- If possible, do your work outside so you have plenty of ventilation
- Do not mix chemicals
- After using a rag with stain, varnish, or most other flammable chemicals, stetch it out flat and let it dry before discarding.

## Getting Help

- If you have questions, or do not feel comfortable running something. Do not feel ashamed to ask for help!
- If you are concerned about the way somebody is operating a machine, please say something. Do not startle them while they are running a machine or anything like that.

__Stay safe, and have fun!__
